**DISMTools** refers to a set of tools and utilities related to the **Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)**, which is a command-line tool used in Windows operating systems for servicing and preparing Windows images, including those used for Windows PE, Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), and Windows Setup. DISM can be used to mount and service Windows images, as well as to repair the operating system.

Here are some common tasks and tools associated with DISMTools:

1. **Mounting and Unmounting Images**: DISM allows you to mount Windows image files (WIM or VHD) so that you can add or remove features, packages, drivers, and updates. After making changes, you can unmount the image and commit the changes.

2. **Servicing an Image**: You can use DISM to add or remove Windows features, install updates, and apply language packs to an offline image.

3. **Repairing a Windows Installation**: DISM can be used to repair a corrupted Windows installation by using the `/RestoreHealth` option with the `ScanHealth` or `CheckHealth` commands.

4. **Managing Drivers**: DISM can add, remove, and enumerate drivers in an offline image or an online operating system.

5. **Managing Packages**: You can use DISM to add or remove Windows packages, such as updates or features, from an offline image.

6. **Managing International Settings**: DISM can be used to configure international settings and language packs in an offline image.

7. **Image Cleanup**: DISM can clean up the image by removing outdated or replaced components, which helps reduce the size of the image.
